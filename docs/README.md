Developer note
--------------

### Tech stacks

Built with Kotlin in mind, this app is fully written in Kotlin frameworks:
* Kotlin for JVM and Android
* Ktor web framework
* Kotlin NoSQL preview
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Gradle Kotlin DSL

Others include:
* MongoDB server.
* Google's Guava, used mainly for its powerful multimap.
* Joda-Time and SLF4J, brought by Kotlin NoSQL.
* Apache POI and some of its commons libraries.
* Personal libraries.

### How to build

To open the project, you're going to need Oracle JDK 1.8, IntelliJ IDEA and optional SceneBuilder.
Testing the app requires authenticated MongoDB server over IP address (or localhost).

Then, simply follow steps below to build [releases]:
* Apply [ktlint] IDE settings (preferably in default-level, not project), if not already.
* Run `./gradlew clean build`, it will automatically perform additional tasks in the process.
  * Generate sources in `app/build/generated`.
  * Check Kotlin code style.
  * Ensure all test specs are successful.
* Use [packr] to build native packages from jar.
